### Built with

- Conditional rendering;
- Passing data with StateContext;

### Continued development

A lot of things to continue working on:

- React hooks;
- Framer-motion advanced animations;
- Need to deepdive into reactDocs - props and data passing trough parent-child elements

### Useful resources
